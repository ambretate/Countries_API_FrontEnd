## APIs
- [Countries API](https://github.com/labandor/API-Project) by [labandor](https://github.com/labandor)

## Tech Stack

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/login)

## Approach

This project was an exercise in using the MERN stack for frontend and backend deployment.

Using the [Countries API](https://github.com/labandor/API-Project) created by [labandor](https://github.com/labandor), I installed the database locally using Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB. From there, I tested the endpoints using both local ports and Postman. 

Once endpoints were validated, I built a React app with full CRUD functionality for each provided endpoint.
